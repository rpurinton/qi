                equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity which subsist or
                will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any
                intellectual property owned by the Operator or third-parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and
                to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service
                marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of
                the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with
                the Services may be the trademarks of other third-parties. Your use of the Services grants you no right or
                license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or third-party trademarks.</p>
            <h4 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h4>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors,
                officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
                special, punitive, cover, or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
                revenue, sales, goodwill, use of the content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated
                savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
                limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable
                party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the
                maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates,
                officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount
                no greater than one dollar or any amount paid cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month period
                before the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also
                apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or failure of its essential purpose.</p>
            <h4 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h4>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
                suppliers, and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, or costs, including
                reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third-party allegations,
                claims, actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your
                Content, your use of the Services or any willful misconduct on your part.</p>
            <h4 id="severability">Severability</h4>
            <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall apply and binding only to
                the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
                necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid, or unenforceable. If any provision
                or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable by a
                court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or
                portions thereof shall constitute their agreement concerning the subject matter hereof, and all such
                remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h4 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute resolution</h4>
            <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be
                governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Maine, United States without regard to its rules on
                conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States. The exclusive
