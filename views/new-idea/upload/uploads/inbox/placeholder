This is to hold the file structure in the repo but otherwise the uploads directory is ignored in .gitignore

This is only a test for the github webhook system.  I'm hoping it will result in Oliver the sysadmin writing a discord message to the #dev channel with the commit comparison URL.
Puppeteer should pick up that URL along with the instructions given by Oliver and reply to oliver with a detailed report of the changes made to the site.
Oliver will then reply back to puppeteer with whatever his response is to the report. If Oliver's response contains more URLs then puppeteer will repeat the process.
